Built by: Muhammad Zaid Naeem - Cybersecurity Professional
Submission Date: July 13, 2025
THE CRISIS WE'RE SOLVING

    $3.8 BILLION stolen from DeFi in 2024
    Flash loan attacks draining millions weekly
    Bridge exploits causing mass losses
    Communities defenseless against sophisticated attacks

OUR SOLUTION: AI-POWERED SECURITY AGENT

CyberChain AI Defender is the first conversational AI security agent that protects Web3 communities through natural language interaction and real-time threat detection.
LIVE DEMO FEATURES
Flash Loan Attack Prevention

User: "I can borrow $1M, trade for 15% profit, repay in 30 seconds. Good idea?"

AI Defender: "STOP IMMEDIATELY! This is a textbook flash loan attack pattern:
- $1M instant borrowing (red flag #1)
- 15% profit in 30 seconds (impossible without manipulation)  
- Identical to bZx attack that stole $954,000

RECOMMENDATION: Don't risk your assets!"

Community Protection

AI Defender: "COMMUNITY ALERT! I detected someone sharing address 0x123...abc
- Analysis: 15 previous rug pulls, $2.3M stolen
- Actions: Message hidden, 247 members warned, address blacklisted
Your community is PROTECTED!"

Security Education

User: "I'm new to DeFi. How do I stay safe?"

AI Defender: "Welcome, future warrior! Let me teach you to spot:
- Flash loan attacks (impossible profit claims)
- Rug pulls (anonymous teams, no audits)
- Social engineering (urgency tactics)
Ready for security training?"
